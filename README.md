# Magic

#### JavaScript implementation of Fitch Cheney's Five Card Trick, a routine in which a magician makes an impossible prediction about a chosen playing card.

Performance: 5 cards are randomly selected from a shuffled, borrowed pack of playing cards and are handed to an assistant. The assistant reads 4 of the cards out loud and the magician is able to deduce the identity of the 5th card without any additional information.

This web app functions as the assistant, allowing you to perform the trick without additional help. To try it out, simply download this repo and open `index.html`.
