# Magic

#### JavaScript implementation of Fitch Cheney's Five Card Trick, a routine in which a magician makes an impossible prediction about a chosen playing card.

#### 5 cards are randomly selected from a shuffled, borrowed pack of playing cards and are handed to an assistant. The assistant reads 4 of the cards out loud and the magician is able to deduce the identity of the 5th card without any additional information.
